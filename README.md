# Steam API Scripts and other Video Game Experiments

Here I will have my scripts relating to Steam API and other video game related experiments that are too small to have an entire repo.

## [Shared-Shared-Game-Checker.py](Shared-Shared-Game-Checker.py)

This script allows you to check for shared games among 2 to 4 profiles using Steam ID's.

TODO:

* Add the ability to check on more then 4 profiles at a time.
* Add filter to list only multiplayer games in common.
